# Task 8
There is an unreal ransomware scam written on dotnet
https://github.com/araujo88/S4VEtheD4TE
The goal is to create an exe and link it to the attack
To activate:
1. for the file: install .net core version 3.1 (exactly) and visual studio -2019
2. create a folder "encryption_tests" ion drive c:\
add file you do not need - they will be encrypted

The idea is to run the attack that will execute the exe file and once it will execute you will see a ransom note.

In the folder attack_exe_file there is the compiled library-> you can download directly but be careful it contains malicious â™¥ Download the folder to the VM
