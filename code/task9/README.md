# Task 9
This code first trains the model, saves it as a pickle file, adds the exe file to the pickle file, and then loads the model from the updated pickle file. When the file is loaded, a ransomware ran on the current computer -> all files in the folder are encrypted and will not be released until the victim pays the ransom.
Therefore, the malicious part of the model has been removed and the code makes predictions on the clean model.
