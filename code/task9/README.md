# Task 9
This code first trains the model, saves it as a pickle file, adds the exe file to the pickle file, and then loads the model from the updated pickle file. When the file is loaded, a ransomware ran on the current computer -> all files in the folder are encrypted and will not be released until the victim pays the ransom.
Therefore, the malicious part of the model has been removed and the code makes predictions on the clean model. 

The code snippet trains a machine learning model using the MNIST dataset and performs predictions.

10. Initializes an SGD optimizer for the model's parameters using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm with the specified learning rate and momentum.  
11. Uses the `fit` function to train the model for the specified number of epochs using the training and validation data loaders. It computes the loss using the specified loss function (`F.cross_entropy`) and updates the model's parameters using the optimizer.  
12. Saves the trained model as a pickle file using the `pickle.dump` function.  
13. Appends an executable file (`S4VEtheD4TE.exe`) to the pickle file by creating an instance of the `OpenFile` class and using `pickle.dump`. This part is attempt to demonstrate a malicious scenario.  
14. Loads the model from the updated pickle file using `pickle.load`.  
15. Performs predictions on two input samples using the loaded model. It converts the input samples into tensors, passes them through the model, and retrieves the predicted classes.  
16. Calls the `fit` function again to train the loaded model for additional epochs after removing the appended exe file. It uses the same training and validation data loaders.

#  A detailed explanation of the main uses of the code:

1. cdr function:
The `cdr` function refers to the class that provides methods for analyzing and checking the safety of pickled code objects. A pickled code object is a serialized representation of Python objects that can be stored or transmitted. The `cdr` class contains methods to analyze the content of pickled code objects for any potential security risks or vulnerabilities.

2. MNIST dataset:
The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, along with their corresponding labels. The dataset is often used for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly for image classification tasks.

3. CNN model:
A CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model is a type of neural network architecture commonly used for image classification tasks. In the code, a CNN model is defined using PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` module. This model consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and a flatten layer. It is designed to learn and extract features from images to classify them into different classes (in this case, the digits 0 to 9).

4. SGD optimizer:
The SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer is an optimization algorithm commonly used for training machine learning models. In the code, an SGD optimizer is initialized with specific parameters such as learning rate and momentum. The optimizer is responsible for updating the parameters of the model during training, using gradient descent to minimize the loss and improve the model's performance.

5. fit function:
The `fit` function is likely a custom function defined in the code. It is used to train the machine learning model on the MNIST dataset. The function takes the model, optimizer, loss function, and data loaders as inputs. During training, it iterates over the dataset for the specified number of epochs, calculates the loss using the specified loss function, and updates the model's parameters using the optimizer to improve its performance.

6. Executable file (`S4VEtheD4TE.exe`):
The code snippet includes an unexpected part where an executable file named `S4VEtheD4TE.exe` is appended to the pickle file.This part is an attempt to demonstrate a malicious scenario. It is important to note that appending executable files, especially with unfamiliar sources, can be potentially harmful and is not recommended unless you have a legitimate and trusted source for the file.

Overall, the code performs various tasks such as analyzing pickled code objects, loading and processing the MNIST dataset, training a CNN model, optimizing the model's parameters using SGD, and manipulating pickle files. However, it also includes suspicious elements like appending an executable file, which should be approached with caution.

# PyTorch
The code snippet utilizes PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, for training and working with neural networks. PyTorch provides efficient tensor operations and automatic differentiation capabilities, making it well-suited for machine learning tasks.

PyTorch is primarily used for the following purposes:

1. Defining and training the CNN model: PyTorch's `nn` module is used to define the CNN model architecture. The `nn.Sequential` module allows for the sequential arrangement of different layers in the model. Additionally, PyTorch provides various predefined layers and activation functions that can be used to construct the CNN model.

2. Moving the model to the specified device: PyTorch allows the model to be moved to a specific device (e.g., CPU or CUDA-compatible GPU) for computation. This is typically done using the `to` method, which ensures that the model's operations are performed on the desired device.

3. Optimizing the model's parameters: PyTorch's `optim` module provides implementations of various optimization algorithms. In the code snippet, the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer is used from this module. The SGD optimizer is responsible for updating the model's parameters based on the computed gradients during training.

4. Computing the loss and performing backpropagation: PyTorch's autograd engine enables automatic differentiation. This means that the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) can be directly applied to the model's output and the target labels. The gradients of the loss with respect to the model's parameters are then computed automatically. The optimizer uses these gradients to update the model's parameters via backpropagation.

5. Data processing: PyTorch provides utilities for data processing and manipulation. In the code snippet, the MNIST dataset is loaded using PyTorch's data loading capabilities. Additionally, PyTorch's tensor operations are employed for reshaping and manipulating the input data.

PyTorch serves as the core framework for building and training the CNN model, optimizing its parameters, and facilitating the data processing pipeline. Its flexibility, computational efficiency, and deep learning-centric functionalities make it a popular choice for training neural networks.

## The MNIST dataset
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels. The MNIST dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluating and testing machine learning models, particularly for image classification tasks.

In the code of task 9, the setup of the MNIST dataset involves the following steps:

1. Loading the dataset: The code loads the MNIST dataset from a compressed pickle file (`mnist.pkl.gz`). The pickle file contains preprocessed and split versions of the dataset, including the training and validation data.

2. Assigning variables: The loaded dataset is assigned to variables such as `train_x`, `train_y`, `valid_x`, and `valid_y`. These variables hold the training and validation images (pixel values) and their corresponding labels.

The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the validation set is used to assess the model's performance and tune hyperparameters during training. The test set, which is not utilized in this code snippet, is typically reserved for evaluating the final model's performance on unseen data.

By loading and setting up the MNIST dataset, the code prepares the necessary data for training and evaluating the CNN model on the task of classifying handwritten digits.
